	<strong>{game-name}</strong>
	<ol>
		<li>
			Basic recruitment talk (Activity on TS and forums, nice behavior etc.)
		</li>
		<li>
			Go over community rules, such as activity on the forums, working with TED threads, and being active on teamspeak.
		</li>
		<li>
			Mention that they are also allowed to play any other game they want in the community.
		</li>
		<li>
			If they are not a part of an ingame clan already, then once you have made them a member, 
			ask them to reply with their in-game name 
			<a href="http://forums.thechaosvanguard.co.uk/showthread.php?t=6650" target="_blank">here</a>.
		</li>
		<li>
			If they are in a clan, figure out which one and make sure they understand that 
			we have members primarily from the alliances Tenno Above All and Deus Ex Tempus (Deus is our primary supporter).
		</li>
		<li>
			ALSO, the most important thing after the rules I want mentioned is 
			to <strong>SPREAD THE WORD</strong> in their clans and alliance about signing up and applying for the forums.
