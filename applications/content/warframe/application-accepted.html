Hello [B]{forum-name}[/B],<br /> 
<br /> 
Your application has been [COLOR="#00FF00"][B]accepted[/B][/COLOR]! Woo!<br />  
<br /> 
Hop on over to our teamspeak server (The URL is ts3.thechaosvanguard.co.uk) and then hop on down to the Warframe Waiting Room channel (image provided below). Once there simply poke one of the Warframe Moderators or Recruiters and they'll meet you up in the waiting room channel to finish out the paperwork.<br /> 
<br /> 
In case you can't find any of the Warframe Moderators and Recruiters or none are on then simply poke anyone else with a game symbol next to their name and they'll be happy to help you out! :)<br /> 
<br /> 
[I]You can poke a TeamSpeak user by right-clicking his name, selecting the 'Poke Client' option and entering a reason for your poke.[/I]<br />
