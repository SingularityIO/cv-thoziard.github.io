			Basic recruitment talk (Activity on TS and forums, nice behavior etc.)

			Go through the rules with them simple test to see 
			if they have read the rules ask them what the first rule is if they cant tell you then go through the rules found 
			<a href="http://thechaosvanguard.co.uk/about-us/community-rules/" target="_blank">here</a>

			Stress the need to be on Teamspeak whenever they are in game on Heroes of the Storm
		</li>
		<li>
			I have been telling people that they are also allowed to play any other game they want. (people don't seem to realize that)

			There is an ingame chatroom for EU and NA. 
			Can be joined by typing /join [Chatroom name] while ingame 
			(<a href="http://forums.thechaosvanguard.co.uk/showthread.php?t=27807" target="_blank">forum post</a> 
			with EU chat room name - 
			<a href="http://forums.thechaosvanguard.co.uk/showthread.php?t=13846" target="_blank">forum post</a> 
			with NA chat room name). Personally, I also tell them about the /who command, 
			which brings up a list of names of the people currently online in the chatroom - 
			those names can be right-clicked and added or invited to the party without having to type anything in chat 
			or be added without having to type their entire battletag. 
			As a bonus to this, new people often get impressed by the sheer size of that in-game list.

		<li>
			Should put their battle tag as their TS name
		</li>
		<li>
			HotS EU hosts daily inhouses as well as monthly tournaments.
		</li>
		<li>
			Put EU in people's TED threads if they're from EU so it's easier to tell them apart, 
			and the same should be done with the NA players as well.
		</li>
		<li>
			While theres not always people on the ts, you can also add people from the list of EU ppl on the forums and see if they're online.
		</li>
		<li>
			Be very sociable make sure to ask alot of questions, 
			A true judge of character is measured in how they tell a story and how much patience they have.
