	<strong>Guidelines</strong>
	<ol>
		<li>
			Find the application. (If he/she has not made one yet, ask them to).
		</li>
		<li>
			Make sure the application has been accepted before you proceed.
		</li>
		<li>
			Create a TED.
			(<a href="http://forums.thechaosvanguard.co.uk/showthread.php?t=63" target="_blank">Link to Instructions</a>)
		</li>
		<li>
			Change the Application’s Prefix to Trial
			(<a href="http://forums.thechaosvanguard.co.uk/showthread.php?t=331" target="_blank">Link to Instructions</a>)
		</li>
		<li>
			Comment on the application saying that the trial has started on {start-trial-date-long} and lasts until {end-trial-date-long} and that you've spoken to the person.
		</li>
		<li>
			Add the link to the TED to the trialist’s description on Teamspeak (Right click on client - Change description) and give them Trialist permissions.
		</li>
		<li>
			Explain everything (How a TED works, what it is, forum/ts/game activity, etc)
		</li>
		<li>
			Explain any further relevant information for the specific game (links, rules, groups, etc)
		</li>
		<li>
			Change the forum usergroup from Guest to Trialist. (If you do not know how to do this, you can find instructions 
			<a href="http://forums.thechaosvanguard.co.uk/showthread.php?t=4661" target="_blank">here</a>)
		</li>
		<li>
			Remind and encourage the new Trialist to be active on both TS and the Forums. (People can fail trials because of this now)
		</li>
